      <title>Info on L-cysteine</title>

      <description>Issue with animal based l-cystine is that it can be from hog hair as well as human hair. China happens to one of the major supplier for it.
If the products do not mention whethert he l-cystine is from non-animal sources (like petroleum etc), then the products should be avoided and not consumed.
You may call the company and confirm the sources.
Shar&amp;rsquo;an two of the sources are problematic. Human Hair and Hog Hair.</description>

      <description>If you look at the ingredients of whatever you are purchasing, it should say &amp;ldquo;Microbial enzymes&amp;rdquo; or something along those lines. This is referring to rennet derived from microbes which is fine. If it just says Rennet then it&amp;rsquo;s doubtful and should be investigated.

      <title>Restaurants in Edmonton</title>

      <description>The only restaurant certified by HMA in the city to my knowledge is Paramount (except the lamb). Every other place typically carries the certificate from their meat supplier and is not certified directly by any organization.
